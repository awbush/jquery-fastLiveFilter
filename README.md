What
----

This is a live filter plugin for jQuery that is built for speed and ease of use.  It was made because existing tools were inadequate (too slow, wrong feature set).  Check out the [demo](http://anthonybush.com/projects/jquery_fast_live_filter/demo/) and [comparison](http://anthonybush.com/projects/jquery_fast_live_filter/comparison/) pages.

Usage
-----

Include jQuery, the plugin, then initialize the plugin:

	<script src="jquery-1.6.4.min.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.fastLiveFilter.js"></script>
	<script>
		$(function() {
			$('#search_input').fastLiveFilter('#search_list');
		});
	</script>

The above would work with this HTML:

	<input id="search_input" placeholder="Type to filter">
	<ul id="search_list">
		<li>One</li>
		<li>Two</li>
		<li>Three</li>
	</ul>

Options
-------

Options are given as the second argument. Synopsis:

	$(INPUT_SELECTOR).fastLiveFilter(LIST_SELECTOR, options);

Available options:

- timeout: How many milliseconds to wait after keydown before filtering the list.  Default is 0.
- callback: A callback method which will be given the number of items left in the list.
- selector: By default, the plugin will match the filter against the text of the `li`. If specifed, the selector will be applied to the `li` and the resulting text will be used instead. **WARNING:** Use of complex selectors may reduce performance significantly, especially in large lists!
- filterAttribute: An attribute of the matched element (li or otherwise) to use for filtering the item, instead of using the visible text.

Example:

	$('#search_input').fastLiveFilter('#search_list', {
		timeout: 200,
		callback: function(total) { $('#num_results').html(total); }
	});
